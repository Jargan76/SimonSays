# Simon Says Vsauce?
### Hey GitHub, Jargan here!
This is my tribute to the classic Simon game with Vsauce inspiration.

If you are not sure what [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game) "Simon Game - Wikipedia") is, you must have been under a rock all your life.


Now the [Vsauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsauce "Vsauce - Wikipedia") inspiration was from their quarterly [Curiosity Box](https://www.curiositybox.com/0H5u3a "CuriosityBox.com") subscription.

As always, Thanks for checking out my code!
